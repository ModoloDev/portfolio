        My name is Lucas, I'm a Software Engineer with over ${new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years of experience in backend development. I love working with JavaCore and frameworks like Spring Boot and Quarkus. I'm also pretty savvy with cloud tech, using AWS and Azure. 
        
        I'm all about design patterns, SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and Domain-Driven Design to keep my code high-quality, scalable, and easy to maintain. My tech skills and strategic thinking in cloud infrastructure have really helped boost system performance and reliability.
